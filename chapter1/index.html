    <p>My favorite drink is coffee. Although many people prefer to add other ingredients or sweeten their coffee, I prefer mine black. To me, this is the best way to have the drink. I personally would rate it as an amazing drink. It tastes good, helps you wake up, and keeps you going throughout the day. If I were to give it a star rating, it would be five out of five.</p>
