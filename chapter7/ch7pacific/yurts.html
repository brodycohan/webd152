                        <br>is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be <br>
                        opened.</p>

                        gas-fired stove.<br> Your luxury camping experience includes electricity

                        with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a <br>sense of
